# üë• Linux User Accounts in Depth

Linux distinguishes between different types of user accounts based on their UID (User ID) and purpose. Understanding the differences between **root**, **system**, and **regular user accounts** is essential for system administration, security, and resource management.

---

## üîê Root User (UID 0)

### What is the Root User?
The **root user** is the **superuser** in Linux, with UID `0`. It has **unrestricted access** to all commands, files, and resources on the system.

### Who Creates the Root User?
The **root user is created automatically by the Linux operating system** during the installation process.

- It is part of the **base system setup**, and the entry is added to system files like `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.
- Created by the **distribution's installer or initial scripts**.
- If you're building a Linux system from scratch (like with LFS), you must manually add the `root` user.

#### Example Entry in `/etc/passwd`:
```bash
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```
| Field           | Value       | Meaning                          |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| username        | `root`     | Name of the user                |
| password marker | `x`         | Refers to password in `/etc/shadow` |
| UID             | `0`         | Superuser UID                   |
| GID             | `0`         | Group ID                        |
| comment         | `root`      | Description or full name        |
| home directory  | `/root`     | Root's personal directory       |
| shell           | `/bin/bash` | Default shell                   |

### Purpose:
- Install and remove software.
- Modify system files and configuration.
- Create, delete, and modify user accounts.
- Set permissions and ownership for any file.
- Perform system-wide backups and restores.

### Characteristics:
- Defined in `/etc/passwd`.
- Home directory is `/root`.
- Shell is typically `/bin/bash` or `/bin/sh`.
- Can become any other user using `su` or `sudo`.

### Security Considerations:
- Extremely powerful ‚Äî misuse can break the system.
- Should be used **sparingly**.
- In many distributions, direct `root` login is disabled via SSH.

---

## üß∞ System Users (UID < 1000)

### What are System Users?
**System users** are created by the system or package manager **during OS installation** or **when services/packages are installed**. These users typically do **not log in** and are used **internally** by services.

### Purpose:
- Used by background services/daemons to run with limited privileges.
- Improves security by ensuring that services can't access files they don‚Äôt own.

### Examples:
| User       | Purpose                        |
|------------|----------------------------------|
| `mysql`    | MySQL database service           |
| `www-data` | Web server (Apache, Nginx)       |
| `sshd`     | SSH daemon                       |
| `systemd-coredump` | Crash handler for core dumps |

### Characteristics:
- UID typically < 1000 (e.g., `mysql:x:110:115:MySQL Server,...`).
- Login shell is often `/usr/sbin/nologin` or `/bin/false`.
- No home directory or one under `/var`.
- Defined in `/etc/passwd`, but no interactive login permitted.

### How They Are Used:
- When a service like MySQL is installed:
  - A **system user `mysql`** is created.
  - **Root user** creates directories like `/var/lib/mysql`.
  - **Ownership** of these directories is set to `mysql:mysql`.
  - MySQL daemon (`mysqld`) runs as the `mysql` user, allowing access only to MySQL files.

  Example:
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql
  ```

---

## üë§ Regular (Normal) Users (UID ‚â• 1000)

### What are Regular Users?
These are human users created by a system administrator or during installation of the OS (e.g., your personal account).

### Purpose:
- Intended for daily system use.
- Can install software locally (without affecting system-wide config).
- Have their own home directories (e.g., `/home/john`).
- Cannot perform administrative tasks without `sudo`.

### Characteristics:
- UID starts from 1000+ (may vary by distro).
- Full login shell and interactive session.
- Can use graphical or terminal sessions.
- Can switch users or escalate to root with `sudo` (if permitted).

### Example:
```bash
john:x:1001:1001:John Doe:/home/john:/bin/bash
```

### Home Directory and Shell:
- By default: `/home/<username>`
- Login shell is usually `/bin/bash`, `/bin/zsh`, etc.

### Privileges:
- Controlled via `/etc/sudoers` or group membership (e.g., `sudo`, `wheel`).
- Cannot access other users' files unless explicitly permitted.

# üìò Essential Files in Linux User Management

Linux user management relies on several critical files that store account details, passwords, default settings, and templates. This document provides an in-depth explanation of each essential file, including historical context, structure, use cases, and security.

---

## üìÇ `/etc/passwd`

The `/etc/passwd` file is one of the oldest and most foundational configuration files in Unix-like systems. Initially, it held **all user information**, including **unencrypted passwords**. For security reasons, password storage was later moved to `/etc/shadow`, leaving `/etc/passwd` to store only public user metadata.

### Historical Purpose
Originally, `/etc/passwd` held:
- Username
- Encrypted password
- User and group IDs
- GECOS field
- Home directory
- Login shell

### Format:
Each line is one user record:
```
username:password:UID:GID:comment:home_directory:login_shell
```

### Example:
```
john:x:1001:1001:John Doe:/home/john:/bin/bash
```

### Field Explanation:
- `username`: Login name (e.g., `john`)
- `password`: Usually `x` (placeholder), real password is in `/etc/shadow`
- `UID`: User ID; `0` = root, `>=1000` = regular users
- `GID`: Group ID; maps to `/etc/group`
- `comment`: Full name or description (GECOS field)
- `home_directory`: Default directory after login
- `login_shell`: Default shell, e.g., `/bin/bash`

### Access Control:
```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1234 Apr 10 12:34 /etc/passwd
```
- Readable by everyone
- Writable only by root

This universal readability allows commands like `ls -l` to resolve UID to username.

### Modern Relevance
Despite moving password hashes out, `/etc/passwd` is still used by:
- `login`, `sshd`, `su`, and other authentication programs
- `ls`, `ps`, and system utilities

It acts as a bridge between the system and human-readable user data.

---

## üîê `/etc/shadow`

### Purpose
Introduced to **enhance security**, this file stores **encrypted user passwords** and **account aging information**. Unlike `/etc/passwd`, it is **readable only by root**, preventing unprivileged users from accessing password hashes.

### Format:
Each line contains 9 colon-separated fields:
```
username:encrypted_password:last_change:min:max:warn:inactive:expire:reserved
```

### Key Details:
- `username`: Matches entry in `/etc/passwd`
- `encrypted_password`: Typically hashed with SHA-512 (starts with `$6$`)
- `last_change`: Days since epoch (1970-01-01)
- `min`, `max`: Control when password changes are allowed or required
- `warn`: Days to warn user before expiry
- `inactive`, `expire`: Post-expiration policies

### Security:
```bash
-r-------- 1 root root /etc/shadow
```
- Only root or PAM-aware utilities like `passwd` can access this
- Use `vipw -s` to edit safely

---

## üìã `/etc/group`

### Purpose
Stores group-related metadata. Helps define **secondary group memberships**, which allow users to share access to files or devices.

### Format:
```
group_name:password:GID:members
```

### Example:
```
wheel:x:10:john,alice
```

- `group_name`: e.g., `wheel`, `sudo`
- `password`: Often unused (`x`), used with `newgrp`
- `GID`: Group identifier
- `members`: Comma-separated list of users

### Practical Use:
Used by utilities like:
- `groups`, `id`, `newgrp`, `chgrp`, `sudo`

### Access:
```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root /etc/group
```

---

## üîí `/etc/gshadow`

### Purpose
Acts as the **shadow version of `/etc/group`**, holding secure group passwords and administrative privileges.

### Format:
```
group_name:password:admin_list:member_list
```

- `password`: Encrypted group password or `!` if not used
- `admin_list`: Users allowed to modify the group
- `member_list`: Normal members

### Security:
```bash
-r-------- 1 root root /etc/gshadow
```
Must be edited with `vigr -s` to maintain system integrity.

---

## üìà `/etc/login.defs`

### Purpose
Contains default **user account creation policies**. Used primarily by tools like `useradd`, `passwd`, and PAM.

### Examples of Settings:
- `UID_MIN`, `UID_MAX`: Define normal user UID range
- `PASS_MAX_DAYS`, `PASS_MIN_DAYS`: Password aging
- `ENCRYPT_METHOD`: Password hash algorithm (e.g., SHA512)
- `CREATE_HOME`: If true, `useradd` will create a home directory

Changes here affect **future** users, not existing ones.

---

## üåê `/etc/skel/`

### Purpose
Holds **template configuration files** copied into every new user‚Äôs home directory when `useradd -m` is used.

### Common Files:
- `.bashrc`
- `.bash_profile`
- `.profile`

### Behavior:
```bash
useradd -m alice
# /home/alice/ gets initialized with files from /etc/skel/
```

# üîê Password Aging Policy and `chage` Command in Linux

Linux provides tools to manage how long passwords remain valid and how often they can be changed. This policy is configured using files like `/etc/login.defs` and tools like `chage`.

---

## üìÅ Relevant Fields in `/etc/login.defs`

| Field            | Meaning                                                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PASS_MAX_DAYS`  | Maximum number of days a password is valid.                         |
| `PASS_MIN_DAYS`  | Minimum number of days before a password can be changed again.      |
| `PASS_WARN_AGE`  | Days before expiration when the user will start receiving warnings. |

**Default Example**:
```conf
PASS_MAX_DAYS   99999
PASS_MIN_DAYS   0
PASS_WARN_AGE   7
```

These values are applied to new users by default.

---

## üìò `chage` Command Summary

The `chage` command is used to view and modify password aging policies per user.

### üîç View current password policy:
```bash
chage -l username
```

### üõ† Set policy for a user:
```bash
sudo chage -M 90 -m 1 -W 7 username
```

| Option | Description                              |
|--------|------------------------------------------|
| `-M`   | Maximum number of days password is valid |
| `-m`   | Minimum days before password change      |
| `-W`   | Days of warning before password expires  |

---

## üìä Sample Output: `chage -l user`
