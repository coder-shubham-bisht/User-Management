## üßç User Management in Linux: In-Depth Guide

---

### 1. User Accounts

#### Types of Users
- **Root User (UID 0)**: Has unrestricted access to all system files and commands.
- **System Users (UID < 1000)**:
  - Created during OS installation or package installation.
  - Used by system services (e.g., `www-data`, `mysql`).
- **Regular Users (UID >= 1000)**:
  - Human users created by the system administrator.

# üìò Essential Files in Linux User Management

Linux user management relies on several critical files that store account details, passwords, default settings, and templates. This document provides an in-depth explanation of each essential file, including historical context, structure, use cases, and security.

---

## üìÇ `/etc/passwd`

The `/etc/passwd` file is one of the oldest and most foundational configuration files in Unix-like systems. Initially, it held **all user information**, including **unencrypted passwords**. For security reasons, password storage was later moved to `/etc/shadow`, leaving `/etc/passwd` to store only public user metadata.

### Historical Purpose
Originally, `/etc/passwd` held:
- Username
- Encrypted password
- User and group IDs
- GECOS field
- Home directory
- Login shell

### Format:
Each line is one user record:
```
username:password:UID:GID:comment:home_directory:login_shell
```

### Example:
```
john:x:1001:1001:John Doe:/home/john:/bin/bash
```

### Field Explanation:
- `username`: Login name (e.g., `john`)
- `password`: Usually `x` (placeholder), real password is in `/etc/shadow`
- `UID`: User ID; `0` = root, `>=1000` = regular users
- `GID`: Group ID; maps to `/etc/group`
- `comment`: Full name or description (GECOS field)
- `home_directory`: Default directory after login
- `login_shell`: Default shell, e.g., `/bin/bash`

### Access Control:
```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1234 Apr 10 12:34 /etc/passwd
```
- Readable by everyone
- Writable only by root

This universal readability allows commands like `ls -l` to resolve UID to username.

### Modern Relevance
Despite moving password hashes out, `/etc/passwd` is still used by:
- `login`, `sshd`, `su`, and other authentication programs
- `ls`, `ps`, and system utilities

It acts as a bridge between the system and human-readable user data.

## üîê `/etc/shadow`

### Purpose
Introduced to **enhance security**, this file stores **encrypted user passwords** and **account aging information**. Unlike `/etc/passwd`, it is **readable only by root**, preventing unprivileged users from accessing password hashes.

### Format:
Each line contains 9 colon-separated fields:
```
username:encrypted_password:last_change:min:max:warn:inactive:expire:reserved
```

### Key Details:
- `username`: Matches entry in `/etc/passwd`
- `encrypted_password`: Typically hashed with SHA-512 (starts with `$6$`)
- `last_change`: Days since epoch (1970-01-01)
- `min`, `max`: Control when password changes are allowed or required
- `warn`: Days to warn user before expiry
- `inactive`, `expire`: Post-expiration policies

### Security:
```bash
-r-------- 1 root root /etc/shadow
```
- Only root or PAM-aware utilities like `passwd` can access this
- Use `vipw -s` to edit safely

---

## üìã `/etc/group`

### Purpose
Stores group-related metadata. Helps define **secondary group memberships**, which allow users to share access to files or devices.

### Format:
```
group_name:password:GID:members
```

### Example:
```
wheel:x:10:john,alice
```

- `group_name`: e.g., `wheel`, `sudo`
- `password`: Often unused (`x`), used with `newgrp`
- `GID`: Group identifier
- `members`: Comma-separated list of users

### Practical Use:
Used by utilities like:
- `groups`, `id`, `newgrp`, `chgrp`, `sudo`

### Access:
```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root /etc/group
```

---

## üîí `/etc/gshadow`

### Purpose
Acts as the **shadow version of `/etc/group`**, holding secure group passwords and administrative privileges.

### Format:
```
group_name:password:admin_list:member_list
```

- `password`: Encrypted group password or `!` if not used
- `admin_list`: Users allowed to modify the group
- `member_list`: Normal members

### Security:
```bash
-r-------- 1 root root /etc/gshadow
```
Must be edited with `vigr -s` to maintain system integrity.

---

## üìà `/etc/login.defs`

### Purpose
Contains default **user account creation policies**. Used primarily by tools like `useradd`, `passwd`, and PAM.

### Examples of Settings:
- `UID_MIN`, `UID_MAX`: Define normal user UID range
- `PASS_MAX_DAYS`, `PASS_MIN_DAYS`: Password aging
- `ENCRYPT_METHOD`: Password hash algorithm (e.g., SHA512)
- `CREATE_HOME`: If true, `useradd` will create a home directory

Changes here affect **future** users, not existing ones.

---

## üåê `/etc/skel/`

### Purpose
Holds **template configuration files** copied into every new user‚Äôs home directory when `useradd -m` is used.

### Common Files:
- `.bashrc`
- `.bash_profile`
- `.profile`

### Behavior:
```bash
useradd -m alice
# /home/alice/ gets initialized with files from /etc/skel/
```
